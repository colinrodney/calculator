      - event delegation pattern(s)
        - Pattern that allows for efficient handling of events.
        
          - Instead of adding an event listener to each similar element, we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event listener on a specific target usin the .target propert of the event object

        - References/ refers to the element that triggered the event

        - Gets the element on which the event ORIGINALLY occurred as opposed to the 'currentTarget' propert which always refers to the element whose event listener triggered the event.
